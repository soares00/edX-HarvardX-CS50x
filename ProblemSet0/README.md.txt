Problem Set 0
The task for this project set was to implement a project in Scratch, meeting the following criteria:

Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
Your project must use at least one sound.
Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than, say, Pikachu’s Pastry Catch and Ivy’s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
Since Scratch projects have no "source code", I cannot include the source code here, but you can access my project here:
